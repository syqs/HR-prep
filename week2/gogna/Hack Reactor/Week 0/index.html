	<h1>Workout Plan 1</h1>
	<p>The first workout plan is chest and triceps. It should be done at the beginning of the week, which would be Monday for me.</p>
	<p>The second workout plan for this would be back and bicep. Everyone loves biceps because we all know that's what people care about the most. Ironically, to have nice arms, we should focus on triceps as much if not more because it is the bigger muscle.</p>
